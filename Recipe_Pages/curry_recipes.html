                Fenugreek leaves are amazing in this, which I found on Amazon. 
            Can use sweet potatoes in this instead of the squash. Be careful, I burnt this on several attempts.</td>

                I added a left-over zucchini I had, putting it in when I put in the tomatoes. I also used canellini beans instead. 
                I ate this with basmati rice and garnished with cilantro.

            <td>The website didn't post the calories, so I used Trader Joe's calories for their version of Thai eggplant curry.
                This was my first time using lemon grass in a recipe, and I loved it! The texture of these little eggplants is quite exquisite. 
                I used a zester to grate the turmeric and ginger. I bought the lemon grass pre-grated and frozen from an Asian Supermarket. 
                I'm a big fan of Chef Buck's recipe videos.
