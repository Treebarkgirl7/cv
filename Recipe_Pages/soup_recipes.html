                comes from the 2 tablespoons of butter that is added to it, which I have yet to try ommitting from the recipe. This picture is also a picture
                of a different bowl of soup that just looks like the soup in the youtube video. Regardless, this is one of my favorite dieting recipes, 
                so I had to put it on here. So much flavor for so few calories!
