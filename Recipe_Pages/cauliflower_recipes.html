              <td>Just an FYI, I think the 56 calories only counts the crust, and not the toppings. Regardless, it's amazing how much this really tastes like pizza!
                I made the crust too thick the first time, and it didn't have the durability of a normal pizza crust.
                This method also requires a bit of muscle when you're squeezing out the water. Squeeze out as much as you can, with every ounce of strength you have! 
                If you want to make this without all that squeezing, I recommend looking up Chef Buck's method of making cauliflower crust pizza on Youtube. 
                That method works well, too.
