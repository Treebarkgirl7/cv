            Definitely pay attention to how she says to cut up the ingredients. It makes a difference.

              <td>Tastes great! It still uses flour though, so it's not that much healthier than bread, but you can use a healthier flour.
                Plus, this has the nutrients of zucchini.
                I tried different types of cheeses with this, even American cheese once. Using American cheese, I would put one slice of cheese on each slice of bread. 
                It doesn't look very pretty, but it tastes great. 
                I think fresh mozarrella cheese is probably the best choice.

                Could have been a little spicier, but not bad. When I used 4 jalopenos in a different attempt, it was great. Could add another, if you are a fan of spicy foods.
